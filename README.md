# Filipino Fake News Neural Network

## Description
Inspired by a research paper released last 2022 (see at the bottom), I decided to develop a fake news classifier model trained with the same dataset, but is constructed using Neural Networks.
For this use case, I used Tensorflow.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:
- **Data**:

  Contains the original .csv dataset (titled "full.csv") as well as its split versions, train and test, with train containing 80% of the data,
  while the test contains the remaining 20%.
  These Datasets are preprocessed by the Data_Preprocessing notebook located in the /Notebooks directory.
- **Models**:

  Contains the models saved through tensorflow's .keras extension; there's minimal difference between each model, but for the purposes of demonstration,
  the _v6 variant was selected.
- **Notebooks**

  Contains the notebooks used to preprocess the data, construct the neural network, and evaluation.
  - Data_Preprocessing contains the preprocessing procedure on the dataset
  - Model_Training contains the neural network construction and its training, as well as some visualization on the model's performance during training.
  - Model_Evaluation contains the neural network's performance on unseen data.
- **img**

  used for storing the images shown here.
- **tools**

  contains the dumped pkl file of the vectorizer used for data preprocessing. I used TfIdf Vectorizer for this case.
  
## Data Source
The dataset was originally sourced from Huggingface:

With the authors:
```bibtex
@inproceedings{cruz2020localization,
  title={Localization of Fake News Detection via Multitask Transfer Learning},

```
The stemming portion of the code would not be possible without the help of this library:
